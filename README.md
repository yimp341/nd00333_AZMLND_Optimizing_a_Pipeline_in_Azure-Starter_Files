# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The information in the dataset is about marketing campaign of a bank, and, each row corresponds to one contact made with a client by means of a phonecall. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. Namely, we seek to predict the column 'y' in the dataset

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best model was given by the AutoML model and turned out to be Voting Ensemble, with an accuracy of 0.91645. This algorithm was fed with XGBoostClassifier, ExtremeRandomTrees and SGD algorithms. 

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
First of all, the dataset is cleaned.

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**


**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
The model was voting ensemble
XGBoostClassifier, ExtremeRandomTrees, SGD

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
